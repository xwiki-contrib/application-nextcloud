## Requirements

In `xwiki.cfg`, the following setting needs to be set:

```
xwiki.authentication.authclass=org.xwiki.contrib.oidc.provider.OIDCBridgeAuth
```

This authentication class is provided by the
[OpenID Connect Provider](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/OpenID%20Connect/OpenID%20Connect%20Provider/)
extension that needs to be installed. This class will look for Authentication
HTTP headers and authenticate users using it through OpenID-Connect if it is
present. This is used for authenticating users from Nextcloud.

## XWiki Application for Nextcloud

This XWiki extension is useful with the
[XWiki Nextcloud application](https://github.com/nextcloud/xwiki),
which needs to be installed on the Nextcloud instances you wish to integrate
your wikis with.
